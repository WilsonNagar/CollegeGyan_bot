# Things still needed to be updated soon: 
1. Data needs to be scraped about each individual colleges showing in the suggestions under each degree as of now, i.e, their mode of admission(results of which entrance exams are accepted); info about starting date of admission,etc. (typing the name of the college by the user should be responded with details about the college and if possible user must be able set a reminder which makes the app send a notification to the user on the date of start of admission/application,etc.

2. If the user has already given an examination for a university, then the bot will be able to predict his/her chances of getting into the particular university based on the score using an ML algorithm.
